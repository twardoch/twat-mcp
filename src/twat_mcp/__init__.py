# To make the plugin discoverable if 'twat' expects to instantiate it directly
# or if you want to provide a factory function.
# For example, if 'twat' calls a function to get the plugin instance:
# def get_plugin():
# return TwatMcpPlugin()

# If 'twat' directly instantiates the class specified in entry_points,
# the class definition above is sufficient.
